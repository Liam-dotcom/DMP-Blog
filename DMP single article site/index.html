                        The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race….It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded.Stephen Hawkins
                    </p>
                    <p>Whether you are aware of it or not, you probably use Artificial Intelligence all the time due to the fact it’s now become integrated in many aspects of life. AI can be found in Smart speakers and most modern phones, listening to sound waves they convert them into words using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR); Then, they convert those words into meanings using Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and can perform any task a user asks, in a fraction of the time.</p>
                    <p>If you’re interested in gaming, odds are, you have also probably played a game with some form of AI in it. Whether you’re into First Person Shooter games like Call of Duty or you like a less intense experience with sandbox games such as Minecraft; Artificial Intelligence is prevalent in both. </p>
                    <p>Surprisingly though, the AI within these two games are actually completely different. FPS games implement Non-Player-Characters (NPC’s) in the form of aggressive enemies that actively hunt you out and seek your demise. This can create a far more immersive and blood-pumping experience for the player.</p>
                    <p>Now, when you think of Minecraft, I bet blood-pumping isn’t an adjective that’d burst into the forefront of your mind. And that’s because of the two games differing Design Goals. Minecraft aims to create a world that inspires authentic exploration and does this through an Ai technology known as Procedural Generation. This is used to automatically, randomly generate an original world each time you play, providing endless replayability.</p>
                    <h1 class="h2"> Gaming not your thing?</h1>
                    <p>Perhaps you’ve heard of the, densely compact in L.A., Tesla cars that completely drive themselves. These cars utilise Deep Learning technologies which are self-learning and extremely responsive, but very unpredictable. Like you can imagine the technology that drives these cars is leaps and bounds ahead of any AI that can be found in modern games today. This can partly be attributed to the fact game developers actually desire predictability when forging AI within games. Predictability ends up providing a means for the player to learn patterns within the game that will help them progress, for example learning the behaviours and attacks of a specific boss so you know when to get out the way! </p>
                    <p>The capabilities of AI are vast, using the same Deep Learning technologies photos of never seen before human faces can be produced, indistinguishable from real human faces. 2.6million of these faces are now available to the public on https://generated.photos/faces.</p>

                    <p class="text-center small text-muted">AI gernerated faces</p>
                    <p>The gaming industry is currently unavailable to fully utilise the capabilities that AI possess. However, forecomings of bridging this gap have started and the same technology has been used to produce art for games and even produce games entirely. These methods enable game developers to save huge amounts of time in production and allow rigorous analysis of players gameplay patterns. Developers can then use this data to enhance user experience and, in a way, play the players while the players play the game.</p>
                    <p>These methods are still undeveloped though and AI within games still has its limits. For these reasons, it could be important to identify another way to use AI within gaming. Due to the fact user experience is so subjective, AI could be used in the future to deliver a more tailored experience within gaming, learning the player’s interests as they play and building the game based on this information. This would be the holy grail of gaming AI and a legendary usability feat.</p>
